								<p>Name: Ulises (Mauricio) Cruz
								<p>Student Number: s3779954	
								<p>Education to date: Vermont Secondary College(VSC), completed VCE at VSC on 2018
								<p>Languages Spoken: Spanish, English
								<p>Random Fact: Working on getting a sleeve tattoo of Mayan deities, I have a dog (blue heeler), a rabbit, 8 guinea pigs and 2 blue tongue lizards.
								<p>Interest in IT: I’ve always been interested in IT in one way or another, starting from playing games and wanting to learn how they work to taking electives in secondary school to begin my journey. My dad being a software engineer and network architect also sparked my interest into following on his footsteps.
								<p>Interest in RMIT: RMIT being a university recognized worldwide and mainly dedicated to technology, it was my first preference to start with my studies and develop a future.

								<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/38632989?searchrequesttoken=cae90945-2c01-4caf-a066-873ed9725b65&type=standout</p>
								<p>A network engineer is a job that involves dealing with the infrastructure of a business as well as the technical part of it, like dealing with networking, Servers, Cloud and Virtualization technologies. This position is appealing to me as it is also a hands on job apart from the basic desk job.</p>
								<p> Skills required:</p>
								<p>- Advanced knowledge in network design and implementation</p>
								<p>- Ability to work with others and clear communication skills with stake holders within the organisations</p>
								<p>- Autonomous working ability</p>
								<p> Present skills:</p>
								<p> None listed above, except the ability to work alone and meet deadlines.</p>
								<p> To achieve the skills listed I will choose electives relating to Network engineering such as computer studies/systems.</p>

								<p>Personality Tests:</p>
								<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality"><p>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test:</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/M&B.PNG" alt="" /></span>

								<p>What do the results of these tests mean for me?</p>
								<p>These results demonstrate the fact that I am outgoing and can relate to people and easily start a conversation with others. This not only allows me to effectively work in a group but also to easily communicate ideas. When in a team this will lead to efficiency and effectiveness. When it comes to forming a team, other outgoing people would lead to easier communication and the ability of the team to remnain in tract and meet the due dates.</p>
								
								<h2 class="major">Project: Home/Work Zone App</h2>
								<p>The home/work area app will be an IOS/android app that detects the location of the user and allows them to customize which settings they will either like on or off in certain areas. For example, when at home the app would automatically turn their data off and maybe set the volume of a device to lower or higher depending of the users preference, and when outside of home or a unknown place settings could be changed automatically (for example turning off the Wi-Fi and turning on battery saver to increase a devices life)</p>
								<p>Motivation: The project will be useful for students and workers as it facilitates the use of mobile devices in “zones” such as work or schools/universities by enabling and disabling the functions that the device provided such as the ability of receiving calls and/or notifications when in certain locations</p>
								<p>Description: The home/work zone app will use Wi-Fi and GPS location detention to find out where the user is, the user will at first be prompted with the notifications to turn their location systems on. Then they shall select a 'Home"! Zone as to initiate the app for the first time. With a Home zone set the user will select their preferred settings when in said place, this could include turning the devices data off when at home and lowering the brightness for example. There would. There would be a high market for said app as it facilitates the user experience and leads to increase of control by the user.<p>
								<p>With the addition of other zones such as friends’ houses and other work environments, for example when connected to a university network, the user will be able to leave the app just in the background as it works without having to input a different command every time. The inclusion of a power saving more will help users get the maximum use out of the app as it will increase a devices life span in a charge by having only certain setting on at any specific place (e.g. Low brightness and data off when at home).</p>
								<p>Tools and skills required: skills required will be the ability to code and create and app mainly targeting android devices at first as they allow user friendly editing without having to include specific software to create an IOS app for ISO devices.  Tools such as the MIT App Inventor could be used to create an app providing a user-friendly interface for the programmer and the ability to run the APK in a emulator program without the need of additional emulator programs. Previous programming knowledge will be required as coding is necessary to change or override the devices system’s way to behaving when in certain locations. The ability of the devices to be connected to the network will be necessary as well as the availability of a GPS system integrated to the device to detect the location of a user and apply the preferred settings of said user to and optimised their devices performance or battery life.</p>
								<p>Outcome: The successful outcome would be that the app works properly and allows the user to set their preferences of settings in different locations and the program successfully switches from the specified settings when in a location to other ones when arriving to a different one. This will not only facilitate user experience from the users when it comes to having devices when in school/work but also enable them to make the most of the devices battery by reducing some settings that may consume more battery than when in alternative low power consumption settings.</p>
